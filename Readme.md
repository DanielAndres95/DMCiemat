## 1. Codes
Inside *programas* you can find a figures directory with the obtained results, a *Exclusion* directory with the codes and some first attemps for study the non relativistic WIMP-Nucleus event rate model. 

1. **EventRate_expression.ipynb** is the theoretical derivation of the equations.
2. **ER.py** shows the dependence of the recoil energy with the wimp mass.
3. **annual_mod.py** is the code that plots the annual modulation of the signal despite of the orbital velocity seasonal variations.
4. **dRdER.py** is the first version of the final code, it is better to use de version 2.
5. The **.pdf** placed in this path are the results obtained with the theoretical model of the interaction that I built in the end of master project.
