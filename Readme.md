# Dark Matter Tools.

## In this repository you can find various Python codes developed to compute important observables of the interaction. Recoil energies for a given nucleus and WIMP as a function of the scattering angle as well as a function of the WIMP masses are computed. Moreover, there are different simulations of the differential recoil spectrum and the exclusion plots
